Improvements:
• Optimized distance and centroid calculations for better performance on large GPX files.
• Improved segment detection sensitivity for high-amplitude activities like alpine skiing.
• Better map synchronization and boundary handling when zooming or panning linked charts.
• More accurate distance calculations for all tracks, including long-distance activities.

Bug Fixes:
• Fixed minor inconsistencies between map and chart distance displays in certain edge cases.
